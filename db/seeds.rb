The sight of its lush green landscape and the scent of olives and citrus from nearby groves is enough to melt away any ounce of stress. And the feel of the sprawling, pebbly beaches beneath your feet or the view of the cerulean waves of the Ionian Sea is enough to make you feel as though you've found paradise.

    The miles of coastline and picturesque beaches are what draws tourists to Corfu each year. Whether you're looking for quiet sands with calm waters or pebbly beaches with plenty of nearby amenities, you'll find it on Corfu.

Many of the top sights, like the Palaio Frourio (Old Fortress) and the Corfu Museum of Asian Art, are centered around Corfu Town. When you're ready to venture to the western side of the island, one-of-a-kind attractions, such as the Paleokastritsa Monastery and the Corfu Donkey Rescue, will be waiting for you.",

Some say that this was the original home of the lost city of Atlantis, which long ago disappeared into the ocean's depths. Whatever remains of this mythological metropolis is now guarded by beautiful beaches and stately whitewashed homes. Today, Santorini consists of two inhabited islands and several islets. Most visitors spend their time on Thira (the archipelago's largest island), which is home to Santorini's major towns, including Fira and Oia. Sleepy Thirassia makes for a relaxing daytrip too. And don't count out the quieter islands: Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni are worth exploring.

    Your first order of business in Santorini is to hit the colorful beaches – the black and red sands make for a memorable visit. Next up, indulge in the archaeological delights of the impressively preserved Ancient Akrotiri or hike to Ancient Thera to see the ruins of three empires, including the Romans. From there, catch a breathtaking view of the caldera, a brilliant turquoise pool of water that serves as the nucleus for the varied isles of this archipelago. Some would say you only need a day to enjoy these islands' charms (they are a popular port of call for cruise ships), but to really drink in all Santorini has to offer, you'll need a few days to a week. Then you'll have plenty of time to learn there's more to these comely dots of the Cyclades than meets the eye.",

    Crete's experiences are as assorted as its history, so take some time to decide what type of vacation you're looking to have before you set anything in stone. For an urban setting with a variety of restaurants, bars and nightclubs, consider staying along the northern coast in Chania or Heraklion. Those who prefer the great outdoors should head to Rethymnon or Agios Nikolaos for the many beautiful beaches.",

Called also by its name in the ancient times, i.e. Megisti, the island has a long history starting in the early Neolithic era. Its ancient name lasted until the Middle Ages, when the knights of St John built Castello Rosso on the reddish rock above the port. Obviously, it is to that high castle with the double walls and the battlements the name of the island is owed. The palmy days started for Kastellorizo at the end of the 19th century thanks to fishing and shipping. Recalling those days there are the beautiful mansions along the coast. The 9 sq km big island became a tourists’ attraction after the Academy Award winner film “Mediterraneo” was shot there some 20 years ago. 
    
    Upon arriving, you will be left speechless by the beauty of the harbour and that will be your rewarding for your long journey. Two or three-storied neoclassical mansions, built amphitheatrically, reflect their colourful facades on the sea and in your eyes. The minaret and the red dome of the mosque of 1755 will definitely catch your attention, no less than the picturesque fishing boats will do.

    Scenic Kastellorizo village is the island’s only populated area. Cobblestone alleys and traditional colourful mansions with wooden and iron balconies beautify your walk through the village’s two quarters, Pigadia and Chorafia.

It was certainly the birthplace of eminent Greek politicians and writers such as Adamantios Korais, Emmanouil Roidis and Alexandre Mavrokordatos. 
    
    Known throughout the world, mastic is an appellation d’origine contrôlée (= controlled designation of origin) product growing only in the South of Chios, where it has been raised since the 8th-7th century A.D. This natural product is cultivated entirely by hand and is nowadays used in medicine, pharmacy, dentistry and cosmetics. At the central market of the town of Chios, you can buy mastic-based jams and sweets, brandies and, of course, local delicious ouzo!

    Chios, part of the Northeastern Aegean island complex, is home to 53,000 people today. Explore the places where these people build their day-to-day lives: either in medieval settlements where Genoa and Chios meet, or in beautiful small towns by the sea, and participate in religious festivities where the locals make their own colourful history, such as the explosive Easter Saturday night in Vrontados.",

Traditional stone mansions, narrow cobblestoned streets, secluded squares and above all the banning of cars and the use of around 500 donkeys as means of public transportation, explain the reason why Hydra preserved its distinctive atmosphere through the passage of time. The island experienced exceptional economic growth in the past thanks to its great naval and commercial activity. The Hydriots contributed significantly also to the 1821 War of Independence as their powerful fleet participated in crucial sea battles. It is rather impressive the fact that such a tiny island is the birthplace of five Greek Prime Ministers! 
    
    Lavish stone mansions owned by important families (Voulgaris, Kountouriotis, Tombazis, Kriezis, Bountouris etc), and built by Italian artisans reveal the wealth that experienced the island in the past. Today most of these mansions house the island’s museums. 300 churches and 6 monasteries spread around the island as well as the cannons and the statues of the Independence War heroes still standing at the balconies of the islands create a romantic mosaic.

    As you walk along the waterfront, the heart of the town, you encounter monuments, churches, canons, museums, old mansions, statues of famous heroes, the old gunpowder store, shops and cafes, while picturesque winding streets lead you to neighborhoods located at the upper part of the town, as well as to the old neighborhood of Kiafas.

    Hydra is also a yachting paradise, as every summer groups of sailing boats moor at the harbour, where they are joined by dozens of sensational motorboats and yachts. It’s worth mentioning that Hydra became famous all over the world thanks to the film “Boy on a Dolphin”, shot on the island in 1957 with Sophia Loren leading the starring role.",

    Skópelos belongs to the North Sporades group of islands and has three main ports: Skópelos, Agnóntas and Glóssa.

    Hóra, on the northern coast, is the capital of the island. Its ancient name was Peparithos, after the son of the god Dionysos and Ariadne, who was the first inhabitant of the island.

Its landscape diversity has resulted in different types of beaches: there are sandy beaches in secluded coves where the tranquil waters are deep blue on the island’s southeastern part; yet, if rugged cliffs and an interesting underwater world are to your liking, try the western part of the island. 
    
    The Venetians, who ruled Zákynthos from 1484 to 1797, called the island “Fioro di Levante” (flower of the East) as there are over 7,000 species of flowers on Zákynthos. The third largest island of the Ionian Sea, after Corfu and Kefaloniá, is internationally known as “Zante”. Zákynthos is said to have been the island’s first inhabitant and the ancient acropolis is attributed to him. He was the son of Dardanos who ruled the ancient kingdom of Frigia. A Venetian fort was built at later times on the site.

    The Venetian architectural influence has left its stamp on Zante despite the damage sustained due to the seismic activity in the area. After the ravaging 1953 earthquake and the ensuing fire, a number of historical buildings and churches burned to the ground. Consequently, the significant treasures these buildings were housing perished. The town was rebuilt according to a plan where strict anti-seismic specifications applied and, to a large extent, respecting the town’s former architectural structure. 

    On Zante, great care is taken to protect two endangered animal species, namely the caretta aretta sea turtle and the monachus monachus seal.",

The party continues in the area of Ammoudiá (on the road to the airport) where entertainment addicts celebrate in big open air clubs! Colourful cultural events, concerts and art exhibitions held throughout summer add a special touch to holidays on the island!",

    long_bio: "While approaching the port of Symi, one has the overwhelming feeling of entering a perfectly painted image of a scenic traditional village. As a rule, people remain agape and cannot take their eyes off the spectacular sight.

    The few who can resist the superb spectacle of the town of Symi stretching its impeccable architecture – all of the buildings there have been listed - on the slopes of the surrounding hills, take off their eyes to look at their book guides. They see the picture of the port of Symi printed on their books. They know it might have been photoshoped; in all likelihood, they expected it to be better than the real thing. Still, when they lift their eyes again to marvel at the breathtaking sight, they realise it belies their expectations: Symi is more than words or photos can say!
    
    In the Byzantine years, economic activities involved shipping, ship building, commerce, sponge fishing, and viniculture. To develop the latter, the Symians had built 120 wine presses all over the island, 11 of which have been reconstructed with the use of their own rock parts; a visit to them is worthwhile as it requires a walk through the refreshing cypress forest of the area of Kourkouniotis.",

    “Ikos”, as was named the island in antiquity, was first inhabited by Stafylos (meaning grape), the son of Dionysus and Ariadne. This myth explains the island’s strong bonds with viticulture from ancient times until today. Urns bearing the stamp “IKION” were exported all around the ancient world confirming the island’s great fame as excellent wine-producing region. According to the myth, Pileas, the father of Achilles, was buried on Alonissos. This is the reason why the island’s second name is “Achilliodromia”. Different versions of this name have survived throughout the years: “Hiliodromia”, “Liadromia”, “Diadromia”.",

    Astypalaia, the westernmost island of the Group, is naturally separated into Mesa Nisi [the inner island] (western part) and Exo Nisi [the outer island] (eastern part) by a thin strip of land less than 100 m. wide.
    
    The island was named after Astypalaia, the daughter of Phoenix and Perimede. In the old days the island was also called Ichthyoessa due to its abundant fishing grounds. It was first inhabited in prehistoric times. In 1204 it came under the Venetian rule enforced by the Guerini family until 1537 with the exception of a brief period in time (1269-1310) when the Byzantine Empire took over again. In 1537 the Turks occupied the island. As is the case with the other Dodecanese islands, Astypalaia remained under Turkish rule until 1912; it was then conquered by the Italians, the British, and the Germans until it was finally integrated in Greece in 1948. There are ferries to Piraeus and Kalymnos and flights to Athens and Rhodes Airports.",

You'll find everything you need from one of the best Greek islands – beaches, natural scenery and lots of sunshine that couples and families will love.",
    long_bio: "The town of Poros is built in the shape of an amphitheatre over two hills. In antiquity Poros consisted in fact of two islands, Sphería and Kalávria, but the last explosion of the Méthana volcano in 273 BC radically changed the morphology of the area. Sphería was cut off from Méthana, and in this way Póros took its present-day form. Lush pine trees vegetation, crystal clear beaches, a lively waterfront adorned with shops, cosy cafes and restaurants, a picturesque capital (it has been declared protected settlement) with grand traditional mansions and picturesque cobbled streets, as well as a wide selection of entertainment venues are the ingredients of this quiet, yet cosmopolitan, destination that attracts visitors from all age groups. 
    
    Peer into the history and tradition of the island through a visit to its Archaeological and its Folklore Museums. Visit also the Temple of Poseidon (built circa 520 BC; the Athenian rhetorician, Dimosthenes, committed suicide in this temple by drinking poison, pursued by Philip, the King of Macedonia); the Zoodohos Pigi Monastery –the most impressive ecclesiastical monument on the island; the Russian naval base and the Residence of Governor Kapodistrias. Follow a route through the narrow streets of the town that will lead you up to a hill, where the trademark of the island stands: the historic Clock tower, where you can relax and enjoy a panoramic view of the whole town.

    Take the opportunity to stroll around the Lemon Forest, a verdant hill with more than 30,000 lemon and orange trees, located on the opposite situated coast of the Peloponnese, southeast of the town of Galatás. The boat trip will only take a few minutes. The view from the hilltop to the island of Póros is really stunning. Take your sailboat to discover the surrounding islets: Boúrtzi, home to the fortress of the Byzantine admiral Nasar; Modi, with its shipwreck from the Mycenaean period, and Daskaleió, with its chapel dedicated to Virgin Mary.

    Poros is also famous for its beautiful beaches, stretching uninterrupted along the island’s coastline. Swim in the crystal clear waters of the long and sandy beach of Askéli; the hotels and bars situated here make it an interesting tourism resort with buzzing nightlife. Meyálo Neório is a sandy beach where the pine trees sweep right down to the water's edge. Bask in the turquoise blue waters of the “Love Bay”, a beach surrounded by verdant pine trees that literally dip their needles into the sea. Enjoy a unique natural shade!",
